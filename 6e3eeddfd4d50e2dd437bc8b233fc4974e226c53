Session Prompts:

User: Can you merge changes from main into this branch?

User: ok, now, in the github actions that were setup for claude, could you make it so it works with the codebuild functionality? Specifically, we should have a clause like this:
name: Hello World
on: [push]
jobs:
  Hello-World-Job:
    runs-on:
      - codebuild-myProject-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello World!"

AWS Documentation for this is here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/action-runner.html

User: ok, now, we need to check on the role the runner runs under. Can we make sure it has full access to Lambda, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch, S3, and appsync?

User: ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.
